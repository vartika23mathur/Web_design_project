                    We believe<br>
                    Learning is the source of human progress.<br><br>
                    It has the power to transform our world.<br>
                    from illness to health,<br>
                    from poverty to prosperity,<br>

                    No matter who we are or where we are,<br>
                    learning empowers us to change and grow<br>
                    and redefine what’s possible.<br>
                    That’s why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege.<br><br>
                    And that’s why Coursera is here.<br>
                    We partner with the best institutions<br>
                    to bring the best learning<br>
                    to every corner of the world<br><br>
                    So that anyone, anywhere has the power to<br>
                    transform their life through learning.<br><br><br>
