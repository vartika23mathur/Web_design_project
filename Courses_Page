                Thanks to a growing number of software programs, it seems as if anyone can make a webpage. But what if you actually want<br>
                to understand how the page was created? There are great textbooks and online resources for learning web design, but most<br>
                of those resources require some background knowledge.<br>
                This course will appeal to a wide variety of people, but specifically those who would like a step-by-step description of the<br>
                basics. There are no prerequisites for this course and it is assumed that students have no prior programming skills or IT <br>
                experience. The course will culminate in a small final project that will require the completion of a very simple page with links <br>
                and images. The focus of this course is on the basics, not appearance.

                The web today is almost unrecognizable from the early days of white pages with lists of blue links.  Now, sites are designed<br>
                with complex layouts, unique fonts, and customized color schemes.This course will show you the basics of Cascading Style <br>
                Sheets (CSS3).The emphasis will be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code,<br>
                 and how to establish good programming habits.<br>
                This is the second course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.Subsequent courses focus on adding interaction<br>

                functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.  You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used<br>
                by JavaScript to identify and modify specific parts of your page.  After the course, learners will be able to react to DOM Events<br>
                and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page.   The class will culminate in a  final project - the creation of an<br>
                interactive HTML5 form that accepts and verifies input.<br>
                This is the third course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.  A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is expected<br>
                when you enroll in this class.    Additional courses focus on enhancing the styling with responsive design and completing <br>
                capstone project.
